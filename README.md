# Internshala PGC Machine Learning

This repository contains project work completed as part of the Internshala Placement Guarantee Course (PGC) in Machine Learning. It includes datasets and a final machine learning project implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Contents

- Machine Learning Final Project.ipynb  
  Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

- ML case Study.csv  
  Dataset used for the machine learning case study.

- Colleges.csv  
  Dataset containing college-related information used in analysis.

- cities.csv  
  Dataset containing city-level data.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning concepts learned during the Internshala PGC program, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model training, and model evaluation.

## Technologies Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
